ZHENG QI
======
I'm Zheng Qi, a graduate student from the Tsinghua University, focusing on Urban Human Factors Engineering. My research interests revolve around data-driven methodologies, leveraging my solid foundation in statistics and modeling to tackle complex urban challenges.

I'm well-versed in various analytical methods, including hypothesis testing and A/B testing, and I have a wealth of experience in the realm of machine learning. My expertise spans across classification, regression, and clustering techniques, with a particular proficiency in LBS (Location-Based Services) data analysis and visualization.
